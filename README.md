Formula 1 - BMI
BMI(kg/m
2) = mass(kg) / height(m)

The BMI (Body Mass Index) in (kg/m
2
) is equal to the weight in kilograms (kg) divided by your

height in meters squared (m)

. For example, if you are 175cm (1.75m) in height and 75kg in

weight, you can calculate your BMI as follows: 75kg / (1.75m2) = 24.49kg/m2
